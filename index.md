I am a PhD candidate in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, focusing on
**AI security, software and AI supply chain security, and trustworthy AI systems**.

My research investigates how complex, multi-stage attacks propagate across
modern software ecosystems, AI pipelines, and agent-based systems, and how
graph-based modeling and secure execution can be used to improve detection,
forensics, and defense.
