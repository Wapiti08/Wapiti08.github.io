## Academic Journey

I am Zhuoran Tan, currently pursuing a PhD in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow
(2023–2026). 

My research background spans software supply/AI security (focusing on runtime detection/defence), cyber defence (practical deployment, multi-source, data fusion), and graph-based learning (graph mining and temporal graph analysis).

I primarily work with Python, Go, and Rust, and I have a strong interest in secure system design and practical cyber defence.

## Industry Stack

With over seven years of industry-orient experience in research and development related to security
analytics, cyber defence system, threat intelligence analysis, and trustworthy AI systems.

- LLM / AI Safety & Security: jailbreak & prompt-injection evaluation, safety guardrails, deepfake detection; PEFT fine-tuning (LoRA/AdaLoRA) and benchmark building, with knowledge on Langchain, MCP, and RAG.

- Security Detection Pipelines: WAF / traffic / log / multi-source data anomaly detection/classification; end-to-end pipelines with automated retraining and monitoring (e.g., Airflow, ELK, Grafana, Zeek, Neo4j).

- Threat Intelligence & Graph Analytics: threat intel analysis and graph-based learning for security analytics.

- Systems Engineering: secure backend/service development for cyber defence systems with Python / Go / Rust.

- Data & Retrieval: vector search / semantic retrieval with Milvus VectorDB. 

- MLOPs: git, Container, SLSA, CI/CD, Hugging Face, Dask, Numba, Ray, DVC, MLflow.

- Cloud: AWS for Machine Learning, Azure for Log Analytics Workspace, BigQuery.

## Certificates

I previously held several professional security-related certificates. Some certifications are no longer active, and others were explored but not completed (e.g., OSCP). I consider certifications as complementary to hands-on research, system building, and long-term academic work, rather than as an end goal in themselves.

- [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty](https://www.credly.com/badges/af3bbd9a-4b71-4055-b090-bb6031144e94?source=linked_in_profile)

- CREST Practitioner Security Analyst (CPSA): Credential ID 266639836

- [CompTIA Security+ ce Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/5cb7ddaa-91ad-4a43-a037-3e678700c820/linked_in_profile)

- Remark: OSCP (tried once: finished 3.5 targets, did not try again due to limited time)
