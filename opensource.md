## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to open-source projects related to AI security, software
supply chain analysis, and reproducible security research.

My contributions include:

- Rust-based secure execution and sandboxing tools (coming)
- Graph-based attack modeling and analysis frameworks (coming)
- Synthetic datasets and benchmarks for AI and supply chain security (coming)

Most projects are released alongside academic publications to support open and
verifiable research.
