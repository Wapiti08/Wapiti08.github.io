## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to open-source projects related to AI security, software supply chain analysis, and reproducible security research.

My contributions include:

- [MCP-Attack-Suite](https://github.com/Wapiti08/mcp-attack-suite): Exposing Developer Pitfalls in MCP Tool Server Security under Multi-Vector Attacks to provide guidance for developer for secure agent/LLM design (arvix coming soon) - 2026
- Synthetic datasets and benchmarks for AI and supply chain security (coming soon) - 2026
- [UTLParser](https://github.com/Wapiti08/UTLParser): Unified Parallel Semantic Log Parsing based on Causal Graph Construction for Attack Attribution - 2025
- [OSPTrack](https://github.com/Wapiti08/OSPTrack): Labelled dataset for simulated package execution with package-analysis - 2025
- [LogAnalyzer](https://github.com/Wapiti08/LogAnalyzer): Prototype of ensemble framework for anomaly detection based on diverse types of logs - 2019

Most projects are released alongside academic publications to support open and verifiable research. For more info please check my github.
